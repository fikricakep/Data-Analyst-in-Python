There's a lot of discussion about and enthusiasm for data science. Using data science, people have been able to build some amazing technologies:

To build data science technologies, we need to give the computer the proper instructions to learn from data. When we give instructions to a computer, we say that we're programming it.

To program a computer, we need to write the instructions in a special language, which we call a programming language. In this lesson, we'll start learning Python, the most popular programming language for data science.

#Instructions

Instruct the computer to add two numbers together, 23 + 7, and return the result. To do that, you'll need to do the following:
