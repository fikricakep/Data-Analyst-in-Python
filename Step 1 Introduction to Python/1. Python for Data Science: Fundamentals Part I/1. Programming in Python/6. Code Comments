#Learn

The computer executes code from the first line downwards and ignores blank lines.

print(5 + 1)
​
print(8 - 7)
​
Output
6
1
Besides blank lines, the computer also ignores any sequence of characters that comes to the right of the # symbol. In the example below, we use # before print(5 + 1), and we see the output of print(5 + 1) no longer displays — this is because print(5 + 1) isn't executed when # precedes it.

#print(5 + 1)
​
print(8 - 7)
​
Output
1
The sequence of characters that follows the # symbol is called a code comment. We can use code comments to add information about our code:

print(5 + 1)
​
print(8 - 7) # This line outputs 1
​
Output
6
1
Another way we can use code comments is adding a general description at the beginning of our program.

# Test program
print(5 + 1)
​
print(8 - 7)
​
Output
6
1
Now let's practice using code comments.

#Instructions

In the code editor on the right, we already added these three lines of code:

#print(34 + 16)
#print(34)
#print(-34)
Uncomment these three lines of code by removing the # symbols, and then click the Submit Answer button.

###Source Code###
print(34 + 16)
print(34)
print(-34)
