#Learn

In the previous exercise, we instructed the computer to perform a single calculation: print(23 + 7). The computer followed the instruction and returned 30 as a result.

However, we can ask the computer to perform more than just one calculation.

In the example below, for example, we instruct the computer to perform two calculations:

print(23 + 7)
print(10 - 6)
â€‹
Output
30
4

To display both results we need to use the print() command.

Now let's practice using the print() command with more than one calculation.

#Instructions
